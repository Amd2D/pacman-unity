# Pac-Man in Unity

Pac-Man is an action maze chase video game where the player controls Pac-Man through an enclosed maze. The objective of the game is to eat all of the pellets placed in the maze while avoiding the ghosts — Blinky (red), Pinky (pink), Inky (cyan), and Clyde (orange) — that pursue him.
